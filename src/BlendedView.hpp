	\brief Blending class: blends synthetised views one by one as they are generated.

	The blending is done by comparing a per-pixel quality, determined by synthesized depth
	maps and the shape of the triangle a pixel lies in: a pixel of good quality has a low
	depth (e.g. in the foreground) and belongs to a triangle with a regular shape (e.g.
	does not lie in a disocclusion).

	Taking the pixel with the maximal quality would give a sharper result, while taking
	the weighted mean is more resistant to errors in the depth maps, color differences
	between the input views and, in the case of navigation leads to smoother navigation,
	with less flickering (BlendedViewSimple). High and low frequencies can be separated with
	a mean blur with a kernel of size of 10% of the image size, and the most adapted
	blending can be applied to each frequency (BlendedViewMultiSpec).
