		- View synthesis of the target view once for each input reference view (see SynthesizedView);
		- Blending all the SynthesizedView together by assigning a per-pixel quality to each synthesized view (see BlendedView);
		- Inpainting to fill the remaining holes (see inpaint());
		- Writing the output (see write_color()).
